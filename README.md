# Image-Colorization
This my attempt at implementing image colorization using the Pix2Pix GAN Model 

Original attempt: https://phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/

Due to lack of training infrastructure trained for only 3k steps but recommended for around 40k steps

results after 3k steps of training:

even though trained only for 3k steps still generated decent images
